# Steps to create the backup

1. Copy the Nintendo 3DS folder (and DCIM if it exists) from the root of your SD card to your computer, then delete it from **the SD card.** On Mac, also empty the Trash.
2. If following Finalizing Setup, hold X on boot, then run the finalize script to perform the NAND backup. If not, hold START on boot and have GM9Megascript back up the NAND using [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/godmode9-usage.html#creating-a-nand-backup). After that, power off the system.
3. Copy the files in /gm9/out (or /gm9/backups if you have followed Finalizing Setup) on your SD card to a safe spot on your computer. Then, delete the files from **the SD card.**
4. Copy the Nintendo 3DS folder to your SD card root, then you may keep the copy on your computer as a backup, or delete it **from your computer.**
